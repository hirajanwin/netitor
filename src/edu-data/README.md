# educational data

The vast majority of these `json` files were automatically generated using our [eduscraper](https://github.com/netizenorg/eduscraper), a web scraper that scrapes educational web literacy info from various websites including [https://developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org), [https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) among others.

The only files created manually are the `index.js` (obviously) and the `css-units.json` (was quicker to do that one by hand then write various web scrapers).
