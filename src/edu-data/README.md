# educational data

The vast majority of these `json` files were automatically generated using our [eduscraper](https://github.com/netizenorg/eduscraper), a web scraper that scrapes educational web literacy info from various websites including [https://developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org), [https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) among others.

The only files created manually are the files inside of the `/modules` directory and `index.js` as well as the `css-units.json` && `css-functions.json` files (was quicker write those by hand then write various web scrapers).
